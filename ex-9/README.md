## Project details
This project involves wiring up two different sections: 
1. Searching, specifcally using filter buttons, whose purposes are to filter the store items by class, and the search filter, whose purpose is to filter the store items by a search. 
2. Allows the user to click on an image and scroll through them using a modal window. **Note** CSS and HTML for this were downloaded, not created, and there is much of it; for this exercise, I appended my own CSS to the main file and didn't follow the exist conventions, whatever they were, as it would've taken longer to understand what was going on here than to write all the code for th exercise.
